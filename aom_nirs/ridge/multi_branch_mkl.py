"""Soft Multi-Branch Kernel for AOM-Ridge (Codex Phase H4).

Extends MKL-light over operators to MKL across *branches*. A branch is a
preprocessing transformer applied upstream of the operator bank (e.g. SNV,
MSC, ASLS baseline correction, EMSC2). For each branch ``b`` and operator
``a`` in the compact bank, build the kernel

```text
K_{b,a} = (Z_b A_a^T) (Z_b A_a^T)^T,   Z_b = T_b(X)
```

The combined kernel is

```text
K_total = sum_b w_b * sum_a (1/B_a) * K_{b,a}
```

with non-negative branch weights ``w_b`` summing to one. Weights are learned
fold-locally by kernel-target alignment (KTA) on the training fold, then
shrunk towards the identity-only weight ``w_none = 1`` to protect small-n
datasets from overfitting high-gain branches such as EMSC2.

Public functions
----------------

- ``kta_branch_score(K_b, YYt)``: alignment between a branch kernel and the
  outer-product target.
- ``learn_branch_weights(branch_kernels, YYt, shrinkage_to_identity)``:
  return the simplex weights blended towards identity.
- ``multi_branch_kernel(X_train, branches, operator_bank, branch_weights)``:
  compose the combined kernel from per-branch operator kernels.

Branch transformers must be cloned per fold; the helpers in this module
never share fitted state across folds.
