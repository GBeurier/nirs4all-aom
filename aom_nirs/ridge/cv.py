"""Repeated cross-validation helpers for AOM-Ridge.

Provides ``RepeatedSPXYFold``: a thin wrapper that runs an SPXY-based fold
generator (``nirs4all.operators.splitters.SPXYFold`` when available, falling
back to ``sklearn.model_selection.RepeatedKFold``) ``n_repeats`` times with
distinct ``random_state`` values to stabilise selection on small / sensitive
datasets such as AMYLOSE.

    ----------
    n_splits : int
        Number of folds per repeat (default 3).

        Number of independent SPXY runs (default 3). Each run uses a distinct

    random_state : int
        Seed for the per-repeat random states.
